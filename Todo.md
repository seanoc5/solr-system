- process archive files
- compare saved vs current directories (name/path/size/date)

  - folders
  - files
    - extract/index contents
      - text files
      - deeper content analysis
- Clustering

## Notes and various
- crawlName logic and 'wipe'
  - if crawlname different, does update/wipe work properly??
  - ExtPasswort vs ExtPassport...???
